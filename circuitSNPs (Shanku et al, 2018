circuitSNP (Shanku et al 2018)

what is the goal

in this experiment we want to see whether specific combinations of footprints can predict 
whether the chromatin is open or closed


then we want to try and predict which SNPs (or genetic variants) can affect open or 
closed chromatin in particular cell types



the goal of our method is to learn the configuration of these switches and ultimately 
in doing so learn whcih genetic variants may alter the cis-regulatory circuit specific
to a cell-type or cell-condition


predict the effect of genetic variants on the overall output

what is the data

the number of DNASE-seq reads and their spatial distribution surrounding each motif

the computational predictions of the centiSNP study: the SNP which affect
the prior-odds of binding for a particular transcription-factor / motif combination
the results of this study used. but this study used same data as CENTIPEDE study

DNase-Seq reads
