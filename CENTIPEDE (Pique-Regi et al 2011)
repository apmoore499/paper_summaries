CENTIPEDE (Pique-Regi et al 2011)

what is the goal

we want to predict the probability that a motif in a regulatory region is bound by a 
transcription factor 


what is the data

TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases
the human genome sequence (hg18) was scanned (all matches above a specified threshold considered to be match)
the experimental daata in a 200-400 bp window around the site to be used in the likelihood
Based on chip-seq data, we know the individual binding locations for TFs across the entire genome



what is the motivation / reason for doing this study

the identification of regulatory regions remains difficult
we don't know which locations in the genome are involved in gene regulation
this makes it difficult to predict the effect of noncoding variants (ie SNP)
Transcription factors bind to motifs in non-coding regions, regulating the transcription of DNA

Chip-seq is inefficient because each experiment profiles just one TF.
Becuase of inefficiency, it's hard to profile more than a few TFs in any tissue, let alone
across different conditions


The computational approaches in this can help but many motifs are not actually bound by TFs


what is the method
